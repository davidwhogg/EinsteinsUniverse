\begin{problem} (From the reading)
What musical instrument did Einstein most enjoy playing?
\end{problem}


\vfill ~

\begin{problem} (From the reading)
Classical mechanics, or Newtonian mechanics, is only valid in certain
circumstances. When do the laws of classical mechanics, like $F =
m\,a$ become wrong or break down? There are many answers to this
problem; I will take anything correct.
\end{problem}


\vfill ~

\begin{problem} (From Problem Set 1)
What is the relationship between the energy $E$ and wavelength
$\lambda$ of a photon? Give a formula that involves energy $E$,
Planck's Constant $h$, the speed of light $c$, and wavelength
$\lambda$ (or whatever you need).
\end{problem}

\vfill ~

\begin{problem} (From Problem Set 1)
What is the approximate thickness of a stack of 1000 20-dollar bills?
No need to be precise, and use any units you like.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} (From Lecture on 2019-09-17)
If you are traveling at 60 miles per hour, how long does
it take you to go 300 miles?

\begin{problem} (From the Math Review Lab)
What is this number? Give your answer in scientific notation.
$$
\frac{(7\times10^{-34})\times(3\times10^8)}{5\times10^{-7}}
$$
You don't need a calculator to solve this problem (\textit{hint: $3/5=0.6$}).
