\section*{\textsl{Einstein's Universe} Problem Set 2}

This problem set is not to be handed in for credit. But it is due
before \textbf{Thursday October 3}, when some of these problems
will appear in part, near-verbatim, on Term Exam 2.

\begin{problem}
In class on 2019-09-05 we started to compute the volume and size of a
water molecule by considering the volume of a block of ice. What,
roughly, is the volume of $18\,\g$ of ice, and therefore what,
roughly, is the volume of an ice molecule? If you think of the
molecule as a cube (yes this is a bad approximation), how big is that
cube (how long are the sides of the cube)? Now do the same for an iron
atom by considering solid iron, and for a lead atom by considering
solid lead.
