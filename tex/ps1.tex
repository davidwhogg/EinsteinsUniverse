\section*{\textsl{Einstein's Universe} Problem Set 1}

This problem set is not to be handed in for credit. But it is due
before \textbf{Thursday September 19}, when some of these problems
will appear in part, near-verbatim, on Term Exam 1.

\begin{problem}
How many cubic millimeters are there in a cubic centimeter? How many
cubic centimeters are there in a liter? How many liters are there in a
cubic meter?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
How many molecules of air are there in one cubic millimeter?
Approximately! You might want to look up the following things: How
many molecules are there in a mole? What is the volume of a mole at
STP? What is STP? Express your answer in scientific notation, and only
give your answer to two digits of accuracy..
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
How many molecules of water are there in one cubic millimeter?
Approximately! Water is $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$; use that to figure
out the mass of one mole of water. Then use the density of water to
figure out what fraction of a mole is in one cubic millimeter. Again,
use scientific notation and only give two digits of accuracy.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What is the speed of light in parsecs per year? Give your answer to
only two digits of accuracy.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What is the energy (in joules $\J$) of a photon with a wavelength of
$\lambda = 0.5\,\mum$? You will have to look up the relationship
between energy $E$ and wavelength $\lambda$; it involves the speed of
light $c$ and Planck's constant $h$. How many photons per unit time
(number per second) does a $2\,\W$ LED emit if you assume that all
that power goes into $0.5\,\mum$ photons? You might have to look up
the definition of a watt $\W$. Use scientific notation to express your
answer and don't forget your units.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
What are the base units of the expression $2\,n\,m\,v^2$, where $n$
has units of number per volume, $m$ has units of mass, and $v$ has
units of speed? The base units are $\kg$ (kilograms), $\m$ (meters),
and $\s$ (seconds). Compare these to the base units of a force and a
pressure.
\end{problem}
