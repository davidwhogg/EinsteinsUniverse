\begin{problem}
  (From Term Exam 1)
  Classical mechanics, or Newtonian mechanics, is only valid in certain
circumstances. When do the laws of classical mechanics, like $\vec{F} =
m\,\vec{a}$ for example, become wrong or break down? There are many answers
to this problem; I will take anything correct.

\textsl{(a)}~energy,
\textsl{(b)}~mass,
\textsl{(c)}~force,
\textsl{(d)}~momentum,
\textsl{(e)}~acceleration.

  This wave on a string is moving to the left. The string is moving only
up and down. Draw arrows at points A, B, and C showing which way those
bits of string are moving.\\

  Reproduce here the triangular path of light you drew for the moving-light-clock problem (Problem Set 3, problem 3), and label the lengths
of the sides of the triangle.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  (From Term Exam 3)
  Muons live for a couple of milliseconds. Naively, therefore, they can't travel more than few hundred meters,
even traveling near the speed of light. And yet, they often are observed to travel many kilometers.
How is this possible?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  (From Problem Set 4)
  Which produces more energy per unit mass?
  Burning fossil fuels,
  nuclear fission with uranium fuel, or
  nuclear fusion with hydrogen fuel?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  (From Problem Set 4)
  An elevator in New York City is accelerating downwards
  at acceleration $g$ (the gravitational acceleration).
  What is the magnitude of the normal force on a box of mass $M$ inside this elevator?
\end{problem}

\vfill ~

\begin{problem}
  (From Term Exam 4)
  In normal space, the straight line (or geodesic) is the path of \emph{shortest
total distance} between two points. In spacetime, the geodesic is the path
of what?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  (From Term Exam 4)
  If you are in a rocket that is moving in the $x$-direction with
respect to the Earth at $0.75\,c$ and, inside the rocket, you are
moving at $0.75\,c$ in the $x$ direction with respect to the rocket,
how fast are you moving with respect to the Earth? No need to
calculate. All I want to know is: Are you moving closer to $0.75\,c$,
$0.95\,c$, or $1.5\,c$?

\begin{problem}
  (From Term Exam 5)
  If a galaxy is moving away at 5 percent of the speed of light, the K
line (which is at a rest-frame or natural wavelength of around $\lambda =
3900$\,\AA), will be shifted to the red. What, roughly, will be the change
$\Delta\lambda$ in the wavelength of the line?

  How much energy was radiated away in gravitational radiation in event GW150914?
  You can give your answer in energy units, or mass units (since, after all, there
  is mass--energy equivalence).
